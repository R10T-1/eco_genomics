transcrptomics notes 
first two sessions were about learning to use deseq2 
the first one was just everyone trying to install it 
today (10/10) we actually ran it 

10/15 
start by running all the code from last time so we can look at how exposures affect expression
dds object is the whole mapping of the gene expression
results file is loookng at specific conditions
log2fold change: shows the compariosn in the gene expression from one treatment to another, but in terms of doubling (as opposed to multplying by ten in a log10)
###anytime you call something from your own data you put quotes around it

in our volcano plot, the significant genes were orange, we saw the orange dots be in the left-most and right-most quadrants 
we see that there is upregulation on the right and downregulation on the left, and this is going from 22 to 18 
each dot on the plot is one gene from all the genes we had after trimming
